# GitHub Action to Calculate & Insert Reading Time

<a href="https://github.com/harunrst/reading-time-action/actions"><img alt="typescript-action status" src="https://github.com/harunrst/reading-time-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg"></a>

Reading time action calculates medium-like reading times of markdown files in your repository and inserts them to the top of your markdown files.

You can;

- Pick your calculation strategy: only readme file, specific paths, and all markdown files.
- Pick your style: regular/bold text, align it to left/center/right.
- Merge and run as you wish;
  - Run on push / manually: get auto-generated PR to your markdown files or push to your branch.
  - Run on pull-request: update your pull request with calculated times.
  - Or do whatever you wish to do with the updated markdowns :)

## Usage

All examples below are triggered only when you make a change on a markdown file. To trigger for the first time, I suggest you run manually using `workflow_dispatch`

## Inputs

- **strategy**: `readme`(default), `paths`(requires 'paths' input), `all`
- **paths**: i.e `docs`, `docs|src/marks`
- **text-style**: `default`(default), `bold`
- **text-align**: `left`(default), `center`, `right`

### Example Workflow File

Updates readme and works on push / manually and creates pull-request. On push triggers only if there is a change on readme file.

```yaml
name: Reading Time

  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '**.md'
